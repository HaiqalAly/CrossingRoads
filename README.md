## ℹ️ Description
Crossing Roads is my first game prototype made using the **Godot Engine**.  
The main goal of this project was to **learn the basics of Godot** and to experience creating and publishing a small game.

The gameplay is simple — the player just needs to **cross the road while avoiding cars**.  
This project contains **one short level** and was made as part of the course:
